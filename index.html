    <p> <strong>The Sad Side Of Cheetahs.</strong></p> 

    <li> Sadly Cheetahs are an endangered animal, which means if we don't take care of them well,
        they will die out soon.</li>
    <li>They have weak jaws and weak canine teeth that means they can't bite into their prey easily,which results them not having food. </li>
    <li>They are slowly losing their habitat because of us humans.</li>
    <li>Lions, lepards, hyena's are all big hunters for baby cheetahs which ruins the cheetahs life in the future.</li>
